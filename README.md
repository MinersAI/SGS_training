## What you will learn

- Core data concepts and preprocessing used in exploration workflows
- Practical analytical methods with real examples
- How to run and explore notebooks in Colab

## Quick tips

- Use the notebook in order from top to bottom.
- If a cell is taking time, wait for the spinning icon to finish.
- You can rerun any cell without breaking your work.
